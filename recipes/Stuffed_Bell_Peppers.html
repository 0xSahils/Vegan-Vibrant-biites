            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li><strong>Prepare the Peppers:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven heats up, take your bell peppers and slice off the tops, making sure to leave enough of the pepper so it can hold the filling. Next, carefully remove the seeds and the white membranes from the inside of the peppers. Set the peppers aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Sauté the Filling:</strong> In a large skillet or pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the diced onions to the pan and sauté them for about 3-4 minutes until they become soft and translucent. Then, add the diced tomatoes, corn kernels, black beans, cooked quinoa, cumin, smoked paprika, and season with salt and pepper. Stir everything together and cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend and heat through. The filling should be warm and slightly softened.</li>
                <li><strong>Stuff the Peppers:</strong> Once the filling is ready, take the prepared bell peppers and spoon the filling mixture into each one. Pack the mixture in gently, but don't overfill or press down too hard. Arrange the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish. They should stand tall, ensuring they’re supported as they cook.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to keep the moisture in while the peppers bake. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10 minutes. This will help to give the peppers a slightly roasted finish and enhance their flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once the peppers are done baking, remove them from the oven. Garnish the stuffed peppers with freshly chopped cilantro for a burst of flavor and color. Serve them warm and enjoy!</li>
