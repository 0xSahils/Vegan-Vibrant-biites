            <!-- Ingredients Section -->
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li><strong>1 can (400 ml) full-fat coconut milk:</strong> This ingredient provides the creamy base for the popsicles. Full-fat coconut milk is preferred for its rich texture and flavor, but you can use lite coconut milk for a lower-fat version.</li>
                <li><strong>1/4 cup maple syrup:</strong> Maple syrup is a natural sweetener that adds just the right amount of sweetness without being overpowering. You can also substitute with agave nectar, stevia, or any other sweetener of your choice.</li>
                <li><strong>1 tsp vanilla extract:</strong> Adds a warm, aromatic flavor that enhances the coconut milk. You can also use vanilla bean paste or a small amount of fresh vanilla bean if you prefer a more natural taste.</li>
                <li><strong>1/2 cup fresh fruit (optional):</strong> Adding fresh fruit like berries, mango, or banana gives a burst of color and flavor to your popsicles. Blend the fruit until smooth for an even consistency, or add chunky pieces for texture.</li>
                <li><strong>1/4 cup shredded coconut (optional):</strong> This adds a delightful texture to the popsicles. Use unsweetened shredded coconut to keep it healthier, or toasted shredded coconut for an extra nutty flavor.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Instructions Section -->
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li><strong>Prepare the coconut milk mixture:</strong> Open the can of coconut milk and pour it into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Use a whisk to stir the coconut milk thoroughly, as the cream and liquid may have separated during storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sweeten the mixture:</strong> Add the maple syrup to the coconut milk and whisk again to combine. Adjust the sweetness according to your preference by adding more maple syrup if desired. If you prefer a sugar-free version, you can replace maple syrup with stevia or monk fruit sweetener.</li>
                <li><strong>Add vanilla extract:</strong> Stir in the vanilla extract to enhance the flavor of the coconut milk. You can substitute with almond extract if you want a slightly different taste.</li>
                <li><strong>Blend fresh fruit (optional):</strong> If you are using fruit, blend your chosen fresh fruit (like berries or mango) in a blender until smooth. You can add a tablespoon of water or coconut milk to help it blend more easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine the fruit (optional):</strong> Pour the fruit puree into the coconut milk mixture and stir gently to combine. If you prefer, you can also layer the fruit at the bottom of the popsicle molds and then pour the coconut mixture on top for a colorful effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare popsicle molds:</strong> Pour the coconut milk and fruit mixture into popsicle molds, leaving a little space at the top to allow the mixture to expand as it freezes. You can use any kind of mold, from traditional popsicle molds to disposable cups or ice cube trays.</li>
                <li><strong>Insert popsicle sticks:</strong> If your molds require sticks, place them in the center of each mold. Ensure they are standing upright so that they freeze evenly in the center of the popsicles.</li>
                <li><strong>Freeze the popsicles:</strong> Place the molds in the freezer and allow them to freeze for at least 4-6 hours, or until solid. If you’re in a hurry, you can freeze them overnight for the best results.</li>
                <li><strong>Remove from molds:</strong> Once the popsicles are completely frozen, remove them from the molds. If they are stuck, run warm water over the outside of the molds for a few seconds to help loosen them.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Serve the popsicles immediately for a refreshing treat, or store them in an airtight container in the freezer for up to two weeks. Top with shredded coconut or additional fruit for extra flavor.</li>
            </ol>
